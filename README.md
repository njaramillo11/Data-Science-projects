This repository contains selected academic and applied data science projects completed during my undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as industry experience. The projects span statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and applied data science, with an emphasis on rigorous methodology and real-world impact. 


"Nancy_M499AB_Senior_Thesis" is my undergraduate senior thesis examining patterns of diversity in mathematics journals. Using publication metadata and statistical analysis, I investigate representation across demographic groups and trends over time, with the goal of understanding structural disparities in academic publishing. The project emphasizes exploratory data analysis, reproducible research practices, and clear communication of results.


"airbnb_final_project" is graduate coursework project focuses on building and evaluating predictive models to solve a real-world problem. I apply feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation techniques, comparing multiple approaches to assess accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. The project demonstrates end-to-end modeling workflow, from data preprocessing to final evaluation.


"M892_final_paper" documents my work as a data science intern, where I applied statistical and machine learning techniques to practical business or research problems. The project emphasizes working with real-world data, collaborating with stakeholders, and translating analytical results into actionable insights. It reflects constraints and considerations typical of industry settings, such as messy data and evolving problem definitions.
